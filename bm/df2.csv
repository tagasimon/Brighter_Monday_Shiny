10,TOR-Consultancy,https://www.brightermonday.co.ug/listings/consultant-5xgpw7,"Dealing with past human rights violations has become a common feature of societies that emerge from an atrocious past characterized by massive violations of human rights. These measures range from justice, truth, reconciliation, guarantees of non-repetition, reparation. One of the key human rights violations following the two-decade war in the post war Northern Uganda relates to land rights. This is because land occupation and ownership have been substantively affected as a result of people fleeing from the over two -decade war. Northern Uganda as a region, experienced about two decades of civil war which arose as a result of rebel activity. This particularly affected the Acholi, Lango and West Nile sub-regions as well as the Karamoja sub-region (Mabikke, S. B. 2011). The government officially ordered the majority of the rural population in the Lango and Acholi sub-regions into Internally Displaced Persons’ (IDP) camps in September 1996 (Branch, A. 2007; Branch, A. 2005; Hopwood, J., & Atkinson, R. 2013). ","NGO, NPO & Charity",Full Time
10,TOR-Consultancy,https://www.brightermonday.co.ug/listings/consultant-5xgpw7,"By 2004–5, nearly two million northern Ugandans had been driven from their homes and fields and relocated to IDP camps (Hopwood, J., & Atkinson, R. 2013). The majority of these, numbering about a million people and comprising more than 90% of the sub-region, came from the Acholi sub-region, where official government-enforced displacement began in 1996 (Hopwood, J., & Atkinson, R. 2013). Thus, 78% of a population originally dependent on subsistence farming was either forced to leave their land altogether or was unable to access it due to the threat of violence from the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) or the orders of the UPDF (Uganda People’s Defense Force) (Adoko, J., & Levine, S. 2004).","NGO, NPO & Charity",Full Time

10,TOR-Consultancy,https://www.brightermonday.co.ug/listings/consultant-5xgpw7,"This extensive displacement led to confusion and uncertainty over land boundaries and land rights, and loss of communal knowledge following the death of elders, which in turn, created a space for the more powerful to engage in land grabbing (Adoko, J., & Levine, S. 2004).  Consequently, in 2006, following the cessation of Hostilities agreement, in which the government declared it safe for formerly displaced persons to return to their pre displacement homes, the region witnessed a remarkable number of land disputes (Hopwood, J., & Atkinson, R. 2013). These disputes have ranged from small to large scale disputes, including disputes involving returnees at the individual level to disputes at a community-level between families and clans.  The disputes further extend to other actors, such as companies who have acquired land on a large-scale basis for investment and commercial purposes and government institutions such as hospitals and schools (Hopwood, J., & Atkinson, R. 2013) as well as individuals formerly displaced onto publicly owned land. ","NGO, NPO & Charity",Full Time

10,TOR-Consultancy,https://www.brightermonday.co.ug/listings/consultant-5xgpw7,"Research shows that returnees have undertaken different paths to have their land disputes resolved and have expressed different reparation needs, ranging from restitution (the return of cattle lost during the conflict and land restitution) to compensation and apologies (Beyond Juba Project, 2010 and 2009; OHCHR, 2007; ICTJ & HRC, 2005). This has meant that they have consulted the several dispute resolution mechanisms, mandated and un-mandated by the law, including the formal court's system, Local Council Courts, Traditional Institutions and many other civil societies who offer legal aid and mediation services.  However, each of the available institutions have limitations, including a lack of coordination between them and because they do not align themselves, this has contributed to unending dispute resolution processes. Thus, none of the land dispute resolution mechanisms have produced outcomes that could be described as transformative. This is because the disputes, as well as land concerns resultant from the war, continue to affect the majority of formerly displaced persons even over a decade after the declaration of the return phase. The National Transitional Justice Policy passed in June of 2019, also acknowledges land conflicts as a post-conflict issue and integral to reintegrating victims back into their communities. ","NGO, NPO & Charity",Full Time

The upcoming research, therefore, seeks to understand the reality of justice paths and the actual challenges faced in restoring land rights before the different forums.
